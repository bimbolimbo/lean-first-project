-- Define order-preserving property
def order_preserving (f : ℝ -> ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∀ x y, x ≤ y -> f x ≤ f y

-- Now construct the proof that f(x) = x is order-preserving
-- Change g to f and you'll find that there are no tactic that would satisfy the property.
-- Find counter-example -> x=0 and y=1.
